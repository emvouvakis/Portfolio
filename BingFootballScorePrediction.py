This project is a Streamlit application that employs EdgeGpt to sent prompts to the Bing AI. 
The purpose is to forecast scores of upcoming football matches.

You can include news about injuries, suspensions, lineup changes of the players and metrics about them to improve your predictions. You can also include data from betting sites for your predictions if that improves the accuracy.  A team"s recent form and motivation can also be factors to consider.
